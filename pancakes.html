        <h2>Whole Wheat Pancakes</h2>
        <p>Pancakes are an easy breakfast to make when you don't feel like really cooking anything,
            using whole wheat flour instead of all purpose can be a bit more healthy for the person
            making them, these can also be frozen and reheated in the oven for quick meals in the
            morning.
